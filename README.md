**Abstract.**

**Stadestér** is an urban population database of tens of thousands of global cities from 3000BC to the present-day as taken from Chandler, Modelski, Reba et al., Populstat, and Wikipedia. Resultant information was hybridised, standardised, geolocated, cubic spline interpolated, and calculated at 1-year intervals using geomean scalars and density trust functions such that more granular data supersedes longer-term vague data, particularly after 1800AD.

Raw dumps of demographic data, cleaned and refined are available from the following sources:
- Chandler (Geolocated, Cleaned)
- Modelski (Geolocated, Cleaned)
- Populstat (Geolocated, Cleaned)

This repository is currently in production, and as such, datasets are not yet complete. Stadestér is a sub-project of both **Eoscala** and **Velkscala**.
